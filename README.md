# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
#### There was evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders which appears to have been altered. Although the full extent of the academic dishonesty is unknown, the school board want to uphold state-testing standards and have requested help to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, replicate the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how the changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
  
  After performing the school district analysis with the adjusted math and reading grade scores, the district summary report yield no significant change. At most, the difference between the initial and adjusted summaries is no more than 0.3%.
